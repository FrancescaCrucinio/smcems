# Analytically Tractable Example

To reproduce Figure 4 run `AT_figure4.m`.

To reproduce Figure 5 run `AT_figure5.m`.

To reproduce Figure 6 run `AT_complexity_vs_M.m`.

To reproduce Figure 7 run `AT_figure7.m`.

To reproduce Figure 8 run `AT_kl_vs_iter.m`.

`AT_exact_variance_recursion.m` gives the variance for the exact potentials in eq (29)
