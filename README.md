A particle method for Fredholm Equations of the First Kind

This repository provides MATLAB code to reproduce the examples of "A Particle Method for Solving Fredholm Equations of the First Kind" by Francesca R. Crucinio, Arnaud Doucet and Adam M. Johansen ([here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09974)).

The folder `gaussian_mixture` contains the scripts to reproduce the example in Section 4.1.

The folder `pet` contains the scripts to reproduce the example in Section 4.2 and Appendix F.

The folder `analytically_tractable` contains the scripts to reproduce the example in Appendix E.1.

The folder `motion_deblurring` contains the scripts to reproduce the example in Appendix E.2.

The 2-dimensional examples require the function `pinky.m` which can be downloaded [here](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/35797-generate-random-numbers-from-a-2d-discrete-distribution).
